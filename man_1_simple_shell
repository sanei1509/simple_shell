Man page for our simple shell.
This simple shell was made by Tarik Calixto and Santiago Neira.

This simple shell was a 12 days project made for HolbertonSchool 31/03/2022 to 11/04/2022 the objective of this project was to reproduce the actual shell but itis not as well optimizated.

Our simple shell reads, interprets and executes a command with its full path or not.

Our simple shell also work in non interacive way you just need to:
without runing ./hsh write:
echo "command -flag" | ./hsh

To compile use:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

To execute use:
./hsh

When the simple shell is up a $ will show up and will wait for the user to insert a command.

$[command] -[flag]

then press enter to execute.

Builtins:

exit - If user writes exit the simple shell will close.

env - If user writes env all environment variables will be printed.

ctrl C - If user press ctrl + C our simple shell wonÂ´t stop it will stil running waiting for another command as input.

ctrl D - if user press ctrl + D our simple shell will close and user will be redirect to the main shell.

Examples:

$ ls will run the ls command and list all files in the directory user is in.

$ ls /tmp will list all files from /tmp directory.

$ pwd will print the working directory.

$ /bin/ls -l will list all files with long format ($ ls -l will work as well).

$ /bin/pwd will print working directory

in the actual shell echo "ls" | ./hsh will work as well in non interactive way
